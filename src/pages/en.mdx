Writing code since 2013 and currently living in São Paulo - SP, Brazil

I love to code, to be with people, and to learn. I feel inspired by projects and products that have the right motivation and impact on people's life. I got 7 years of experience working on web development, mainly with Javascript related technologies.

In 2009 I was accepted on the [best](http://ruf.folha.uol.com.br/2014/rankingdecursos/cienciadacomputacao/) Brazilian's Computer Science course of that year, and 5 years later I received my bachelor's degree in the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Right after that on my first job, I [won](https://exame.abril.com.br/tecnologia/plug-in-informa-quem-financia-candidatos-as-eleicoes/) a Hackathon with the Projeto Brasil team, building a browser extension that shows to voters who are financially supporting the candidates at Brazil's president election.

One year later, I met [Naty](/img/naty-pedro-show-pearl-jam.jpg), and I never thought that less than 2 years after that, she would be my wife and life partner. And she gave me a gift that I'll never be able to thank her enough: [Mia](/img/pedro-mia.jpg).

At the end of 2019, I embraced an adventure of moving from Belo Horizonte-MG to São Paulo-SP, to pursue a new professional challenge at [Loggi](https://www.loggi.com), which I now work for, as Senior Software Engineer, alongside an [amazing team](/img/loggi.jpeg).

In my free time, I like [hugging](/img/naty-pedro.jpg) Naty, [playing with](/img/pedro-mia.jpg) Mia, listening to [podcasts](https://lists.pocketcasts.com/678b4503-b6a9-43ca-bf83-075ff6ca86fe) about diverse topics, and reading about computer science and technology.
